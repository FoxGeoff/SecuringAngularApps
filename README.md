## Author:Brian Noyes

A little over a year ago I released my course with the subject name. 
At that time (and for about 4 years prior, the guidance from the IETF (standards body for the protocols) 
was to use Implicit Flow for SPA clients (Angular, React, etc.). 
That changed end of last year when they put out updated guidance recommending Authorization Code Flow with PKCE.
